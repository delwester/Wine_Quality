# Wine Quality
A Wine Quality prediction model

Many wine brands are seeking new ways to maximize the success of their wines. Before making any decisions, 
it might be helpful to know which features contribute to a wine's quality. Knowing these features can enable 
a brand to make more intelligent decisions when making it. But what exactly are these features?  I plan to 
answer this question using ML techniques, python and wine data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality
